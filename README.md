# Humble Superheroes Frontend

A React application for managing superheroes with humility scores.

## Collaboration Notes

As a team player, I believe we could improve this project through:

- **Code Reviews**: I welcome feedback on the component structure and TypeScript implementations
- **Pair Programming**: Would love to pair on implementing advanced features like filtering/sorting
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Can schedule brief sessions to discuss the optimistic UI updates pattern used
- **Documentation**: Happy to collaborate on improving inline comments and API documentation
- **Testing Strategy**: Would like to discuss testing approaches with the team

## If I Had More Time

Given more time, I would explore:

1. **Technical Improvements**

   - Add comprehensive test coverage (Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add loading states and better error handling
   - Set up proper CI/CD pipeline

2. **Feature Enhancements**

   - Add filtering by humility score
   - Implement sorting capabilities
   - Add superhero categories/tags
   - Implement edit/delete functionality
   - Add data persistence
   - Add user authentication

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Set up Storybook for component documentation
   - Improve TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Add proper logging system
